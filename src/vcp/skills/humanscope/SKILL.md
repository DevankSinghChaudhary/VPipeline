name: humanscope
description: Remove the structural fingerprint that makes narrative writing read as AI-generated, by forcing story-shape decisions before drafting and auditing drafts against measured human baselines. Use whenever the user is writing, rewriting, or checking a story, screenplay, scene, short film script, reel script, personal essay, or any narrative they will publish under their own name. Trigger on "make this sound human", "does this read like AI", "humanize this", "check this for AI tells", "why does my script feel generic", "rewrite this so it doesn't feel AI", and also trigger before drafting any new narrative piece so the structure is chosen up front instead of patched later. Built on StoryScope (Russell, Rajendhran, Pham, Iyyer, Wieting; University of Maryland and Google DeepMind; COLM 2026), which separates human from AI fiction at 93.2 macro-F1 using narrative structure alone and stays at 93.9 after the prose is professionally rewritten.

# HumanScope

## The one fact this skill is built on

Style edits do not work.

The StoryScope researchers took AI-generated stories and ran them through a professional-grade rewriting system that removes cliché, purple prose, and redundant exposition. Detection fell from 95.5 to 93.9. A drop of 1.6 points. Almost nothing.

Then they removed every stylistic feature from their model. No word choice, no sentence rhythm, no figurative density. Structure only. It still scored 93.2.

**The fingerprint is not in the words. It is in the shape.** So this skill operates on the shape, and it operates before the draft exists wherever possible.

Never satisfy a HumanScope request by rewording. Rewording is the failure mode this skill exists to prevent.

## The second fact, which is easy to miss

Do not invert the AI pattern.

Human writers still resolve stories through protagonist choice 46% of the time. Still avoid subplots 57% of the time. Still write linearly most of the time. Human writing scores as human because it is **dispersed** across the possible choices, not because it sits at the opposite extreme.

A story that flips all thirty features is a new formula, and a worse one. It reads as deliberately difficult.

**Target the human rate, not the opposite of the AI rate.** Every number in `references/core-features.md` gives both. Use them.

## Two modes

Work out which one applies, then say which one you are running.

- **Mode A, Structure First.** The user wants something written. Run this before drafting.
- **Mode B, Audit.** A draft already exists. Score it, report it, then restructure what needs it.

If the user hands you a draft and asks for something new in the same style, run B on the draft first, then A on the new piece.

## Mode A: Structure First

Do not write prose yet.

Produce a **Structure Sheet** of ten decisions. For each one, state the choice and the reason. One line each. Then get the user's sign-off, or if they told you to just go, write the sheet and the draft together with the sheet on top.

The ten decisions, with the human rate and the AI rate for calibration:

| # | Decision | AI default | Human rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Timeline.** Straight through, or jumps? | mostly linear (2.12 on 1 to 5) | 2.40, more flashback and flash-forward |
| 2 | **Subplots.** None, one parallel, one contrasting, one unrelated? | no subplots 79% | no subplots 57%, thematically parallel 42% |
| 3 | **What causes the ending.** Protagonist's choice, mixed, or outside force? | protagonist choice 69% | protagonist choice 46% |
| 4 | **How it ends.** Internal acceptance, external action, or unresolved? | internal understanding 47% | 27% |
| 5 | **The moral.** Does the narrator ever say what the story means? | says it 77% | says it 52% |
| 6 | **How emotion arrives.** Body sensation, plain word, or behaviour? | embodied 81%, plain word 8% | embodied 38%, plain word 29% |
| 7 | **How the lead enters.** Described, mid-action, in dialogue, or in thought? | described from outside 52% | 30% |
| 8 | **References.** A real named thing, or a vague echo? | vague echo 72%, named 24% | vague echo 50%, named 47% |
| 9 | **Reader address.** Does the piece ever acknowledge someone is reading? | almost never, 0.07 | 0.28 |
| 10 | **Is the lead morally clean?** | clean 62% roughly, ambivalent 38% | ambivalent 59% |

### The budget rule

Do not deviate on all ten. Pick **three or four** to break hard, and let the rest sit wherever the story naturally wants them. A story that goes nonlinear AND drops the moral AND ends on outside force AND names three real books AND breaks the fourth wall is not human. It is a student film.

Choose the deviations that serve the story. Say why in one clause. If you cannot say why, do not deviate there.

### The default is the enemy, not the choice

The reason AI writing clusters is that it takes the default on every axis without noticing there was an axis. A human writer who thinks about it and still writes linear, protagonist-driven, and moral-free is fine. The sin is not the linear timeline. The sin is not knowing you picked it.

So when you fill in the sheet, write the reason even for the choices where you stay with the common option.

### Then draft

Write the piece from the sheet. While drafting, the two hardest habits to break are:

- **Emotion through the body.** Tight chest, cold sweat, throat closing. AI does this 81% of the time versus 38% for humans, the single biggest gap in the whole study. Sometimes just write that she was scared. Humans say the feeling out loud 29% of the time. AI does it 8%.
- **The closing line that explains.** Cut it. If the last paragraph tells the reader what the story was about, delete the paragraph. Check the second-to-last one too.

Also watch smell. AI reaches for smell in 82% of stories, humans in 57%. Not a rule, just a tic worth noticing.

## Mode B: Audit

### Step 1, score

Read `references/core-features.md`. Go through all thirty features. For each, mark where the draft actually sits and whether that leans AI or human. Do not guess from vibes. Point to the line or scene that proves it.

### Step 2, report

Give the user a table with three columns: feature, where the draft sits, which way it leans. Then a plain count: how many of the thirty lean AI.

Be honest about the count. If it is a human-written draft that scores clean, say so and stop. Do not invent problems to look useful.

### Step 3, sort the fixes

Split what you found into two lists.

**Structural.** Ending cause, moral statement, timeline, subplots, resolution mode, character entry, reference specificity. These need real rewriting, sometimes a new scene or a cut scene. These are the ones that move the needle.

**Cosmetic.** Word choice, sensory density, prose rhythm. Mention them if they are bad, but tell the user plainly that fixing these will not change how the piece reads structurally. That is the LAMP result: professional-grade prose editing moved detection by 1.6 points.

### Step 4, fix

Rewrite only the structural items, and only the ones the user picks. Show the change as a decision, not a diff: "the ending currently resolves because she decides to forgive him. Moving it so the phone call comes anyway, whether she decided or not."

Never present a reworded sentence as a fix for a structural problem.

## Scope limits, state these when they apply

The study measured short stories averaging 4,753 words. The findings are strongest there.

- **Feature films and novels.** Applies well. Same narrative machinery, more of it.
- **Short scripts and short films.** Applies, with care. A five-page script has no room for a subplot, so decision 2 mostly resolves to "none" and that is fine, not an AI tell.
- **Reel scripts, captions, LinkedIn posts, ad copy.** Applies partially. The findings that transfer are the moral statement, the emotion delivery, and the named-versus-vague reference. Timeline, subplots, and resolution mode mostly do not apply at sixty seconds. Say so rather than forcing all ten.
- **Documentary, tutorial, and explainer scripts.** Explaining the point is the job. Decision 5 does not apply. Decisions 6, 8, and 10 still do.

Do not pretend the whole framework fits a caption. It does not, and claiming otherwise is the kind of thing that gets caught.

## Model fingerprints

If the user asks which model wrote something, or wants to write against a specific model's habits, read `references/model-fingerprints.md`. Six-way attribution is only 68.4 macro-F1, much weaker than the human-versus-AI split, so treat any single guess as a lean and not a verdict.
